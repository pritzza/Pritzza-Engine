# Pritzza-Engine
An uncreative name for another one of my attempts at a 2d game engine. Uses SFML and C++ 17.

## Current Features
- Entity System
- Dynamic Camera
- Animated Sprites

- Other Stuff
  
# Engine Demo
Randomly generated isometric tilemap using Reputeless's implementation of perlin noise.

## Controls
  - Movement: WASD
  - Zoom In/Out: E
  - Regenerate Terrain: Q
  - Change Gamestate: MMouse

## Todo
  - Clean up code
  - Finish implementing Text class
  - Make isometric tile collision
  - Expand tilemap to allow chunks and procedural generation
